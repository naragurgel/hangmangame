## Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- Log in Heroku.
- Click New and select 'Create new app'
- Choose a name for the app, region and click on 'Create app'.
- Only 'Deploy' and 'Settings' are relevant from the menu section. Starting with the 'Settings' first.
- Now Buildpacks need to be added. They install future dependencies that are needed outside of the requirements file. The first is Python and the second is node.js. Python needs to be selected first and then node.js. Save this selection.
- Now the 'Deploy' section needs to be selected from the menu and connect it to github.
- Enter the name of the repository we want to connect it with and click 'Connect'
- The choice appears now to either deploy using automatic deploys or manual deployment, which deploys the current state of the branch.
- Click deploy branch.
