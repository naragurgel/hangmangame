## Libraries used


## Testing

### Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

For each python file in your project, run it through the pep8online validator

- [PEP8 Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#)

### Manual Testing

**Feature 1**
- Welcome message is working.
- Input asking user name is working.
- Input with the question "are you ready to to play" Y/N is working.
- Input to type the letter or word tries is working.
- Number of tries is changine everytime when the users is incorrect. 
- Letters guessed list is working.
- Words guessed list is working.
- Alert when the use insert a invalid input working.
- Alert when the user run out of tries.
- Input asking if the user wants to play again Y/N working.
- Good Bye message working.

### Defect Tracking

Try to create issues in real time as it better reflects the daily life of a developer.

The easiest way to track defects is by using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them. At this stage you don't need a custom template or labels, that comes in P4.

### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found as long as:
- it does not impacting a user from completing a vital function on the website
- it only affects a very small subset of users
- is an extreme edge case that very few users would try

If you know of something that isn't quite right, create an issue and  link to it here and explain why you chose not to resolve it. 

Sometimes it's as simple, word wrapping issue that makes the site look odd at a certain screensize that you just didn't have time to fix due to the impending deadline and lack of skills. It's best to mention it but note why you allowed it to go live than let asccessors think you didn't notice it. 

### Commenting Code


## Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- Log in Heroku.
- Click New and select 'Create new app'
- Choose a name for the app, region and click on 'Create app'.
- Only 'Deploy' and 'Settings' are relevant from the menu section. Starting with the 'Settings' first.
- Now Buildpacks need to be added. They install future dependencies that are needed outside of the requirements file. The first is Python and the second is node.js. Python needs to be selected first and then node.js. Save this selection.
- Now the 'Deploy' section needs to be selected from the menu and connect it to github.
- Enter the name of the repository we want to connect it with and click 'Connect'
- The choice appears now to either deploy using automatic deploys or manual deployment, which deploys the current state of the branch.
- Click deploy branch.

#### Fork the repository
Make a fork so you have a copy of the repository in your own git hub account: https://github.com/maliahavlicek/portfolio_project_03

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132136504-eb79a6f3-0205-4c82-80c2-eef136ec7e4c.png)


### Gitpod
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in gitpod.  Such as install requirements.txt  and setting up a creds.json file that is in the gitignore and keeping their workspace.

If you have project settings required such as a creds.json file from the GOOGLE DRIVE API acess, please provide an example of that file in the writeup with the project key values:
```$python
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_email": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "auth_uri": "https://accoutns.google.com/0/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cer_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "clien_x509_cert_url": "<YOUR_VALUE>"
}
```

If you have any dependencies, you should instruct users to install them
```$python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Heroku
ðŸš¨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to Heroku. Include screenshots if you think they would make the process easier.

You may want to re-watch the [python essentials deployment video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LS101+2021_T1/courseware/293ee9d8ff3542d3b877137ed81b9a5b/e3b664e16366444c8d722c5d8340b340/?child=first) when writing up this section.


If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values.
Do not share your personal keys but either cut them out of the screen shot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such values.

1. Fork the repository

Make a fork so you have a copy of the repository in your own git hub account: https://github.com/maliahavlicek/portfolio_project_03

2.  New Project
Log into Heroku and create a new project. Name it something like XXX_coders_bistro.


3.  Settings
On the settings tab you have to address two things:
A. **Config Vars**

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132135869-215d2e0f-805d-40a8-a8c2-fb1098e2645d.png)

  At a bar minimum you should show the user that they need to add the PORT. 8000 key value pair.


B. **Build Packs**

  add Python Then Node.js


4. Deploy
A. Set up to github and select the correct repository:

B. Deploy either manual or automatic
